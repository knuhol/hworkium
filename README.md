# Hworkium

Do you also hate housework as much as me and my wife do? Don't worry, Hworkium is here to help you get rid of it quickly and do something what is a real fun soon!

People usually struggle to do housework because they find hard to manage it and decide on who will pick up a which task. This piece of code will do this for you! Do a simple setup, click a button and that's it - every household member has assigned a task list respect the amount of work which is required - so everybody should be done approximately in the same time.

### How Does It Work
It's fairy simple. All you need to do is to follow these steps:

1. Go to Janitor page and add all household members who will participate on housework.
2. Go to Tasks page and add all tasks which has to be done.
3. Go to Works page and lick a magic button.

Read your tasks list and, well, do the housework (the boring part).

That's it!

### Demo
Demo is hosted on [hworkium.000webhostapp.com](https://hworkium.000webhostapp.com/). 

#### Version 1.0
This is a first version on this app which works but needs lot of improvements.

- __Feature:__ All data persist in your browser. Feel free to refresh or come back later. Once you add/remove janitor or tasks, the works list is reset.
- __Missing:__ Better UX/UI. Inform when no janitors/tasks are in the system, loading data screen, better responsive design, more icons etc.
- __Missing:__ Other languages support.
- __Missing:__ Partially manual selection of tasks as an alternative to randomization.
- __Missing:__ Checking done tasks.
- __Missing:__ User accounts to persist data permanently and share over devices/within a household.
